\section{Introduction}
Go over the objectives of the experiment relying on new research in your literature review. 
\section{Experiment 1}
Many Experiment Frameworks require two experiments, one with $x$, the other without. These are often referred to as control experiments.

\section{Experiment 2}
All experiments are repeated for reproducibility, you need to show how each stage of the experiment is designed to help prove or disprove your hypothesis. 

\section{Summary}
You have no results, however, you have a clear and concise experiment to run. With your knowledge from Literature Review you can mention the expected outcomes of each experiment.
